## Introduction and Objectives
This project showcases a comprehensive approach to incident response operations using Microsoft Sentinel within the Microsoft Azure platform. The primary objective was to implement a structured incident response process following the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Plan. This involved setting up the necessary infrastructure, detecting and analyzing potential security incidents, containing and eradicating threats, and finally documenting and closing out incidents. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in handling real-time security threats in a cloud environment and to highlight the capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel in orchestrating a robust incident response strategy.

## Technologies Employed
- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>: Core cloud platform used for deploying and managing the infrastructure.
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel</b>: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool used for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.
- <b>Log Analytics Workspace</b>: Used for ingesting and analyzing logs.
- <b>NIST 800-61 Incident Response Plan</b>: Framework followed for structuring the incident response process.
- <b>Incident Response PlayBook</b>: Employed to guide the containment, eradication, and recovery phases of the incident response.

## Methodologies/Execution of Process
The execution of this project was based on the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Plan, covering the following key phases:

### Step 1: Preparation

Ingested all relevant logs into Log Analytics Workspace and Microsoft Sentinel.
Configured alert rules to monitor and detect potential security incidents.
### Step 2: Detection & Analysis

<b>Set Severity, Status, Owner</b>: Assigned priority and responsibility for the incident.

<b>View Full Details</b>: Conducted a detailed review of the incident.
<b>Observe Activity Log</b>: Monitored the incident's history and progression.

<b>Observe Entities and Incident Timelines</b>: Analyzed the behavior of involved entities and the timeline of the incident.
<b>Investigate the Incident</b>: Used Sentinelâ€™s investigation tools to map the attack and determine its scope.
<b>Inspect Related Events</b>: Examined related alerts and events involving the suspect entities.

### Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Followed a structured Incident Response PlayBook to contain the threat, eradicate it from the system, and recover affected services.

## Report Note
> CUSTOM: Brute Force SUCCESS - Windows
Incident number 116 <br>
The incident activity log has been created by Alert Grouping. Entity suspect 
49.147.201.7 has been tagged to be from the Philippines. Suspect IP raised 2 successful brute force alert targeting the resource honeypot1. Suspect IP is also related to several other high and medium severity alert incidents, implying that this IP is a malicious entity aiming to inflict damages or harm into the resource. On the same note, resource "honeypot1" has also been tagged to be related to several other brute force alert incidents and malware detection. The state of this resource indicates that it is overexposed to the public, providing easy access to persistent malicious activities from the net. <br>
Upon expecting the logs associated with the entity IP, the incident has been confirmed to be true positive. <br>
Will now proceed to the next step, remediating the incident by following the Incident Response PlayBook. The associated Network Security Group has been locked to only allow authorized traffic into the resource. Resource's password has also been reset and MFA has been implemented. <br>
This case will now be document and close out this incident.

## Insights and Implications
This project offered valuable insights into the effective application of the NIST 800-61 framework in a cloud environment. It underscored the importance of real-time detection and analysis, demonstrating how quick identification and response to security incidents can significantly reduce their impact. The use of automated playbooks was particularly effective, streamlining the containment and recovery processes while ensuring consistency and reducing the potential for human error.

Additionally, the project highlighted the critical role of collaborative investigation and entity analysis in understanding the broader context of an incident, leading to more accurate and targeted responses. Finally, the emphasis on thorough documentation and post-incident analysis provided a strong foundation for continuous improvement, enabling the refinement of future incident response strategies and enhancing the overall security posture of the cloud environment.

## Conclusion
The execution of this project demonstrates a deep understanding of incident response operations in a cloud environment. By leveraging Microsoft Sentinel and adhering to the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Plan, I was able to efficiently detect, analyze, and mitigate a security incident. The experience has reinforced the importance of preparation, swift detection, and comprehensive documentation in handling cybersecurity threats.
